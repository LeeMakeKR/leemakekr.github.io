# About LeeMakelog

LeeMakelog is a project log covering electronics, firmware, mechanical design, and fabrication experiments. The goal is to document builds clearly enough that others can adapt the ideas for their own workshops.

## Focus Areas

- Embedded systems and rapid prototyping
- Machine design, 3D printing, and custom tooling
- Documentation that captures both successes and lessons learned
