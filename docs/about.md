# About Lee Make Log

Lee Make Log collects electronics builds, firmware experiments, and fabrication notes in one place. The aim is to document each iteration clearly so other makers can replicate or remix the ideas.

## Focus Areas

- Embedded systems, connected devices, and rapid prototyping
- Mechanical design, 3D printing, and custom tooling
- Honest documentation that captures both successes and lessons learned
