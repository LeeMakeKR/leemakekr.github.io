# Lee Make Log

Welcome to **Lee Make Log** — a project log for electronics, 3D printing, CAD, and maker experiments.

## What is this site?

This site is a personal project log where I:

- Document hardware / electronics builds
- Archive 3D printing and CAD experiments
- Keep notes about firmware, embedded systems, and prototypes
- Collect links, references, and troubleshooting tips

You can think of it as a **living notebook** for my maker projects.

## About me

I enjoy designing circuits, building tools, and documenting the process.  
This page will grow as I add more projects and notes.
